It keeps a vocabulary, curated examples, and adapters that can be hot-swapped without downtime. Respond with a concise, friendly description of AlmondAI's purpose and subsystems."}

These artifacts let the learner restore adapters, retrieval indices, and vocab so fine-tuning can resume immediately after a restart."}
{"constraints":{},"prompt":"Explain how AlmondAI curates and reuses training samples during continuous learning.","provenance":{"prompt_hash":"seed::curation_cycle","source":"seed","teacher_hash":"18070388884670627812"},"teacher_output":"Every approved prompt/response pair is normalised by the curator, appended to data/training_data.jsonl, indexed for retrieval, and optionally reserved as evaluation data. When new training begins, the learner replays these curated samples so adapters and vocabularies stay aligned with the model's production experience."}

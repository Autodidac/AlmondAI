How about you?  <eos>\nGood morning  <eos>\nGood afternoon  <eos>\nGood evening  <eos>\nGood night  <eos>\nWhat's up  <eos>\nWhat's new  <eos>\nNot much  <eos>\n\nBonjour (French)  <eos>\nKonnichiwa (Japanese)  <eos>\nAs-salamu alaykum (Arabic) → Wa alaykum as-salam  <eos>\nHola (Spanish)  <eos>\nSawasdee (Thai)  <eos>\n\nIn Japan, people bow to show respect.  <eos>\nIn many Middle Eastern cultures, the left hand is not used for eating.  <eos>\nIn France, it's common to kiss on both cheeks when greeting friends.  <eos>\n\nThe human brain has about 86 billion neurons that communicate through signals.  <eos>\nThese neurons form networks responsible for thinking, memory, and movement.  <eos>\n\nIn quantum mechanics, particles can exist in a state of uncertainty until observed.  <eos>\nThis idea is often described using the example of Schrödinger's cat.  <eos>\n\nThe Renaissance was a time of cultural and scientific growth in Europe.  <eos>\nKey figures include Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo Galilei, and Johannes Gutenberg.  <eos>\n\nThe Great Wall of China spans over 13,000 miles and was built to protect against invasions.  <eos>\nIt includes watchtowers, garrisons, and signal beacons.  <eos>\n\nFree will is the idea that humans can make choices independent of external forces.  <eos>\nDeterminism argues that all events are caused by prior causes, making free will an illusion.  <eos>\n\nIn Japan, people use chopsticks for eating. Pointing them at others is considered rude.  <eos>\nIn many Middle Eastern cultures, using the right hand for eating is preferred.  <eos>\n\nTime flows from past to future in physics.  <eos>\nEinstein's theory of relativity shows that time can be affected by gravity and speed.  <eos>\n\nIf every part of a ship is replaced over time, is it still the same ship?  <eos>\nA moving object can never reach its destination because it must cover half the distance first, then half of that, and so on infinitely.  <eos>\n\nShould you steal medicine to save a dying loved one if no one else has access to it?  <eos>\n\nThe weather is nice today. I enjoy sunny days.  <eos>\nI feel tired but I will keep going.  <eos>\nMaking mistakes is part of learning.  <eos>\nSometimes things go wrong, but we can fix them.  <eos>\nBad choices often lead to bad outcomes.  <eos>\n\nWars can last for many years.  <eos>\nDynasties often change over time.  <eos>\nJapan has a rich history of cultural traditions.  <eos>\nFormality is important in some cultures but less so in others.  <eos>\n"}

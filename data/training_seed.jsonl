{"prompt":"Summarize the purpose of AlmondAI in two sentences.","teacher_output":"AlmondAI is a lightweight C++20 runtime that stitches together tokenization, adapters, retrieval, and governance so researchers can ship iterative language model experiments quickly. It balances production-friendly APIs with hooks for continuous learning so teams can plug in external teacher models and keep deployments fresh.","constraints":{"style":"concise"},"provenance":{"source":"seed","prompt_hash":"seed:almondai-overview"}}
{"prompt":"List three safety checks the AlmondAI PolicyGovernor performs.","teacher_output":"The PolicyGovernor scans the candidate output for terms on a configurable blocklist, watches for obvious credential or secret patterns, and flags potentially unsafe generations so operators can decide whether to release or redact them.","constraints":{"format":"sentence"},"provenance":{"source":"seed","prompt_hash":"seed:policy-governor"}}
{"prompt":"Explain how the retrieval index augments generation responses.","teacher_output":"Before generating a reply, AlmondAI queries its retrieval index with the incoming prompt, decodes any matching documents into natural language, and appends those snippets to the model input so the student has grounded context to draw from.","constraints":{"audience":"engineer"},"provenance":{"source":"seed","prompt_hash":"seed:retrieval"}}
